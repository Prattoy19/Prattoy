           My name is Md. Habib-E-Alam Siddiqui Prattoy but everyone calls me Prattoy. I am 18 and reading Diploma Eng in Cloud Computiong Technology. I live at Panchagarh, Bangladesh. We have a joint family where my grandmother is our major guardian, eight uncle, cousins live in the same house. We love each other very much and are closely related to grandparents. All family members are open-minded and friendly. I have a group of 5 friends however Shihab is my best friend. He is true, honest and looks so nice. We both are in the same class and school. Normally, I like to hear and tell jokes and stories to my friends. I help my younger cousins in doing their home works daily. I love my parents very much. They also love me and promote me to do well in every field. They motivate and inspire me to study. My family is a cultural family. When we celebrate each festival together, we enjoyed it and have a great time. Really, I am fortunate to have this family. <br><br>

           In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class football team. I am the best football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert swimming. The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; is's in you.” <br><br>

           I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news. Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk. I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people. <br><br>

           These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
